Changes in version 1.0
----------------------

* Forked Uncommons Antlib 0.3.3 and removed DocBook and Maven support.

* Converted names, packages and paths to Rectangular Software ones.

* Simplified macros by assuming all projects are single-module Android apps.

* Updated to latest versions of TestNG, ReportNG, Cobertura and Proguard.

* Fix for Proguard obfuscation on case-insensitive file systems.

* Output Proguard mapping file by default.

* Load properties from local.properties by default.

* Improved support for building multiple versions of the same app.

* Improved support for incremental build (avoid rebuilding artifacts
  unnecessarily).

* Derive latest build tools version automatically so it doesn't have to be
  specified unless a different version should be used.

* Make all debug builds debuggable regardless of manifest.

* Helpful error messages if required properties are not set or minimum Ant
  version is not met.
