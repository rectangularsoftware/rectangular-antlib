SYNOPSIS

  The Rectangular Antlib provides macro definitions, custom tasks and other
  tools to support the development of native Android apps using Apache Ant.
  It is derived from the Uncommons Antlib (http://antlib.uncommons.org).


LICENCE

  Rectangular Antlib is licensed under the terms of the Apache Software Licence
  version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).


DEPENDENCIES

  Rectangular Antlib requires APACHE ANT VERSION 1.7.1 or later and an
  up-to-date installation of the Android SDK.


CONVENTIONS

  Currently, in version 1.0, Rectangular Antlib retains the conventions
  inherited from Uncommons Antlib except, since there is only one module, the
  project directory and module directory are the same thing.  See
  https://github.com/dwdyer/uncommons-antlib/wiki/Conventions for full details
  of the Uncommons Antlib conventions.

  In subsequent versions of the Rectangular Antlib the conventions will be
  updated to be more consistent with the standard Android project layout. This
  will improve interoperability with other Android development tools.
