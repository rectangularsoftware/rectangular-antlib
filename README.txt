SYNOPSIS

  The Rectangular Antlib provides macro definitions, custom tasks and other
  tools to support the development of native Android apps using Apache Ant.
  It is derived from the Uncommons Antlib (http://antlib.uncommons.org).


LICENCE

  Rectangular Antlib is licensed under the terms of the Apache Software Licence
  version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).


DEPENDENCIES

  Rectangular Antlib requires APACHE ANT VERSION 1.9.1 or later and an
  up-to-date installation of the Android SDK.


CONVENTIONS

  Currently, in version 1.0, Rectangular Antlib retains the conventions
  inherited from Uncommons Antlib. This means there are some minor differences
  in directory layout compared to standard Android projects. See the wiki for
  full details of the conventions used.

  Subsequent versions of the Rectangular Antlib will move towards using
  standard Android directories and tools. The biggest change will be to switch
  from using TestNG for unit testing to use the default JUnit-based system.
